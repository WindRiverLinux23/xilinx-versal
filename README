2. BSP Kernel and Distros
=========================

The following table summarizes the valid Wind River Linux distros for this BSP.
'Y' in each content cell stands for supported; 'N' stands for not supported:

  +--------------+-------------+------------------+-------------------+--------------+
  | valid/distro |   wrlinux   | wrlinux-graphics | wrlinux-installer | wrlinux-tiny |
  +--------------+-------------+------------------+-------------------+--------------+
  |    valid     |      Y      |        N         |         N         |       N      |
  +--------------+-------------+------------------+-------------------+--------------+

For the supported kernel type for this BSP, check the TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES
by running 'bitbake -e | grep "^TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES"'.

Note: The preempt-rt ktype is available for this BSP/Machine at this time.

3. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP along with
patch descriptions use git-whatchanged on the default kernel. For example:

	%> cd tmp-glibc/work-shared/<bsp_name>/kernel-source
	%> git whatchanged <kernel_version>/standard/base..<kernel_version>/standard/<bsp_name>


4. Boot Instructions
====================

You must load the DTB (device tree blob) into the target's memory
prior to booting the kernel Image. The DTB file can be found in the export
directory after building a project, or you can generate it manually with the
following commands:

	# bitbake -c devshell virtual/kernel
	# vim arch/arm64/boot/dts/xilinx/the_file_you_edit*.dts
	# make xilinx/dtb-file-name

The dtb-file-name includes the following dtbs:
	versal-vck190-rev1.1.dtb
	versal-vmk180-rev1.1.dtb
	versal-vck190-rev1.1-x-ebm-01-revA.dtb
	versal-vmk180-rev1.1-x-ebm-01-revA.dtb
Please use the right one for different board.

The resulting DTB file can be found here:
path_to_project/build/tmp-glibc/work/<bsp name>-wrs-linux/linux-yocto/<kernel version>/linux-<bsp name>-<kernel type>-build/arch/arm64/boot/dts/xilinx/

Assuming all files can be downloaded from a network, deploy your board and host
properly to ensure your network is available from the board.

4.1 NFS boot
------------

4.1.1 Setup configuration your NFS TFTP server, and deploy the rootfs tarball
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	# sudo tar jxf wrlinux-image-std-xilinx-versal.tar.bz2 -C path_to_rootfs

4.1.2 Set the u-boot environment variables and boot from NFS
------------------------------------------------------------

	=> setenv bootargs console=ttyAMA0 earlycon=pl011,mmio32,0xFF000000,115200n8 clk_ignore_unused root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=serverip:path_root_rootfs ip=dhcp
	=> tftpboot 0x10000000 Image; tftpboot 0x13800000 dtb; booti 0x10000000 - 0x13800000

5. WIC Notes
============

User can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator to create the properly partitioned
image on a SD card. It generates partitioned images from existing OpenEmbedded
build artifacts. Please refer to the following URL for more detailed partition
information about WIC:

https://docs.yoctoproject.org/singleindex.html#creating-partitioned-images-using-wic

5.1 Build a WIC image within prebuilt BOOT.BIN
----------------------------------------------

BOOT.BIN is the bootloader for vmk180/vck190 boards. It can be downloaded from the website:

https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/18842316/Linux+Prebuilt+Images

and then add one line below to local.conf:

IMAGE_BOOT_FILES:append = " /< path-to-BOOT.BIN >/BOOT.BIN;BOOT.BIN"

After having built your project, a partitioned WIC image will be created in the
deploy folder as follows:

  path_to_your_project/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/xilinx-versal/wrlinux-image-<rootfs_type>-xilinx-versal.wic

There are two partitions in this WIC images, the first one is to hold the boot
images(including kernel/dtb/BOOT.BIN), the second is the related root file system.

5.2 Build a bootable WIC image
------------------------------
Besides the above method which uses prebuilt BOOT.BIN, WRLinux can build BOOT.BIN and
create a bootable WIC image by following the steps as below:

     $ cd path_of_project
     $ . ./environment-setup-x86_64-wrlinuxsdk-linux
     $ . ./oe-init-build-env
     $ cat << _EOF >> conf/local.conf
CUSTOMER_RECIPES:xilinx += 'bootgen'
CUSTOMER_RECIPES:xilinx += 'u-boot-xlnx-scr'
CUSTOMER_RECIPES:xilinx += 'xilinx-bootbin'
CUSTOMER_RECIPES:xilinx += 'psmfw'
CUSTOMER_RECIPES:xilinx += 'plmfw'
CUSTOMER_RECIPES:xilinx += 'base-pdi'
CUSTOMER_RECIPES:xilinx += 'arm-trusted-firmware'
CUSTOMER_RECIPES:xilinx += 'device-tree'
CUSTOMER_RECIPES:xilinx-tools += 'external-hdf'
CUSTOMER_RECIPES:virtualization-layer += 'python3-dtc'
CUSTOMER_RECIPES:xilinx-standalone += 'psm-firmware'
CUSTOMER_RECIPES:xilinx-standalone += 'plm-firmware'
BB_NO_NETWORK = '0'
IMAGE_BOOT_FILES:append = " \${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}/boot.bin;BOOT.BIN"
IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " xilinx-bootbin"
HDF_MACHINE = "vmk180-versal" or HDF_MACHINE = "vck190-versal"
YAML_DT_BOARD_FLAGS = "{BOARD versal-vmk180-reva-x-ebm-01-reva}" or YAML_DT_BOARD_FLAGS = "{BOARD versal-vck190-reva-x-ebm-01-reva}"
_EOF
     $ bitbake wrlinux-image-std

After building project, a partitioned WIC image will be created in the deploy folder as follows:

  path_to_your_project/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/xilinx-versal/wrlinux-image-<rootfs_type>-xilinx-versal.wic

5.3 Boot the board from the WIC SD card
---------------------------------------

Insert the SD card into the board and power on, then set the proper u-boot
environment parameters to boot the board, please refer to section 4 for more
information.

Board can boot automatically by set the below uboot environment variables:

=> setenv bootfile Image; setenv fdtfile dtb-file-name; setenv loadaddr 0x10000000; setenv fdtaddr 0x18800000;

=> setenv bootargs 'root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw console=ttyAMA0 earlycon=pl011,mmio32,0xFF000000,115200n8 clk_ignore_unused rootwait'

=> setenv bootcmd 'fatload mmc 0:1 $loadaddr $bootfile; fatload mmc 0:1 $fdtaddr $fdtfile; booti $loadaddr - $fdtaddr';

=> saveenv; run bootcmd;

6. kexec and kdump
===================

You need to add feature/kexec support as follow:
	./wrlinux-x/setup.sh --machines xilinx-versal --templates feature/kexec,feature/kdump

6.1 kexec
---------

	kexec -l  /boot/Image --append="`cat /proc/cmdline`"
	kexec -e

6.2 kdump
---------

Add crashkernel=512M to the kernel cmdline
   kexec -p /boot/Image --append="$your-bootcmd"
   echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger

7. Features
===========

7.1 System Monitor
------------------

System monitor includes PL monitor and PS monitor.
Each system monitor measures voltage and temperature to provide information and alarms
to other parts of the system including the PMU, RPU, and APU processors.

Customer could check the detail system monitor interfaces with below command:
	# ls -la /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0

7.2 QSPI
--------

There are QSPI NOR Flash at the X-EBM-01 QSPI external daughter card, please make sure that
the X-EBM-01 card is installed on J212 of the VCK190 board. And should use the specific dtb
file versal-vck190-rev1.1-x-ebm-01-revA.dtb for vck190 board or versal-vmk180-rev1.1-x-ebm-01-revA.dtb
for vmk180 board which can be found at the path:

path_to_your_project/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/xilinx-versal/

7.3 CANFD
---------

There is one canfd device interface J5 at board. Connect the canfd interfaces of 2 boards and use
the following verification commands:

VCK190/VMK180 board-1:
	# ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 125000 dbitrate 8000000 fd on
	# candump can0 &
	# ip -d -s link show can0

VCK190/VMK180 board-2:
	# ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 125000 dbitrate 8000000 fd on
	# cansend can0 5A1#11.22.33.44.55.66.77.88
	# cansend can0 5A1##000112233445566778899aabbccddeeff
	# ip -d -s link show can0

If can0 at board-1 can dump data from board-2, CANFD feature works fine.

7.4 USB
-------

For VMK180/VCK190 board, the USB controller can be configured as host, device modes.

7.4.1 USB Host
--------------

For Host mode, short the jumper 1-2 of J308:
	J308
	1-2 3

7.4.2 USB Device
----------------

For Device mode, open the jumper 1-2 of J308:
	J308
	1 2 3

In addition to the method which modifies "dr_mode" property in dts file, you can change this property
by using "fdt" u-boot command. The example for USB device mode is as described below:

    => tftpboot 0x10000000 Image; tftpboot 0x18800000 dtb
    => fdt addr 0x18800000; fdt resize; fdt set /axi/usb@ff9d0000/usb@fe200000 dr_mode peripheral
    => booti 0x10000000 - 0x18800000

Use the below example settings for configuring USB as MASS STORAGE profile to verify the device mode:

	root@xilinx-versal:~#dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/mydev count=500 bs=1M
	root@xilinx-versal:~#cd /sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget
	root@xilinx-versal:~#mkdir g1
	root@xilinx-versal:~#cd g1
	root@xilinx-versal:~#echo "64" > bMaxPacketSize0
	root@xilinx-versal:~#echo "0x200" > bcdUSB
	root@xilinx-versal:~#echo "0x100" > bcdDevice
	root@xilinx-versal:~#echo "0x03FD" > idVendor
	root@xilinx-versal:~#echo "0x0501" > idProduct
	root@xilinx-versal:~#cat max_speed
	root@xilinx-versal:~#echo "high-speed" > max_speed
	root@xilinx-versal:~#mkdir functions/mass_storage.ms0
	root@xilinx-versal:~#mkdir configs/c1.1
	root@xilinx-versal:~#echo /tmp/mydev > functions/mass_storage.ms0/lun.0/file
	root@xilinx-versal:~#echo 1 > functions/mass_storage.ms0/lun.0/removable
	root@xilinx-versal:~#ln -s functions/mass_storage.ms0/ configs/c1.1/
	root@xilinx-versal:~#echo "fe200000.usb" > UDC

Connect the cable from board to Windows or Linux host machine, and the mass storage device
can be observed.
